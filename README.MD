# BlockHouse assessment

Hello, in this readme I will describe how to run the project

# Pre reqs

Before we start running the code please make sure you have django and node installed on your device

# Start the servers
 in the main directory "your_path/blockhouse" run python manage.py runserver 
 this will start the django back end on port 8000

 After you have the django server running cd into chart-app "your_path/blockhouse/chart-app"
 and run "npm run dev" this will start the Next.js front end on port 3000

# Enjoy!

Now you are able to view the website!
